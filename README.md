A reactive math quiz application built with TypeScript and a custom signal-based state management system.

**Live Demo**: [https://multiplicationdrill.github.io](https://multiplicationdrill.github.io)

## Features

- **Interactive Math Quiz**: Practice multiplication with timed questions and answers
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert
  - Easy: 2-5 range
  - Medium: 4-8 range
  - Hard: 6-12 range
  - Expert: 10-20 range
- **Manual Mode**: Increment counter manually or with auto-update
  - Dynamic multiplier based on difficulty level
  - Auto-update every 3 seconds when enabled
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes with persistent preference
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Settings Persistence**: Your preferences are saved locally

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **Vite 7**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Custom Signal System**: Reactive state management inspired by SolidJS
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and Yarn

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/multiplicationdrill/multiplicationdrill.github.io.git
cd multiplicationdrill.github.io

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run development server
yarn dev
```

### Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn preview` - Preview production build
- `yarn test` - Run tests
- `yarn test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `yarn test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `yarn lint` - Run linter
- `yarn type-check` - Check TypeScript types

## Architecture

### Signal System

The application uses a custom reactive signal system for state management:

- **Signal**: Holds a value and notifies observers when it changes
- **ComputedSignal**: Derives values from other signals, with automatic dependency tracking
- **effect**: Runs side effects when dependencies change

### Project Structure

```

## Testing

The project uses Vitest for unit testing:

```bash
# Run tests
yarn test

# Run tests with UI
yarn test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage
```

Tests cover:
- Signal system functionality
- Utility functions
- State computations
- Local storage persistence

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the master branch:

1. Tests run on Node.js 22.x and 24.x
2. Linting and type checking are performed
3. If all checks pass, the app is built and deployed
4. Deployment uses GitHub's native Pages action

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Code Quality

- All code must pass TypeScript type checking
- ESLint must pass with no warnings
- All tests must pass
- New features should include tests

## Recent Changes

- **Dynamic Multiplier**: The manual mode now uses a multiplier based on the difficulty level instead of always using 10
- **Improved Build System**: Migrated from single HTML file to modular TypeScript with Vite
- **Added Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Vitest
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment with GitHub Actions
