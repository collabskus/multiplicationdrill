Looking at your CI/CD pipeline and package.json, here are the updates needed:

## Changes Required:

### 1. **Node.js Versions**
Your pipeline tests on Node 20.x and 22.x, but Node 22 wasn't LTS when this was written. Current recommendations:
- **Node 20.x**: Current LTS (good)
- **Node 22.x**: Now stable, but consider if you need it
- **Node 24.x**: Latest version you're actually using locally

### 2. **Coverage File Path**
The pipeline references `./coverage/coverage-final.json` but based on your scripts, you should use `./coverage/lcov.info` or the correct coverage format that Vitest generates.

### 3. **Add E2E Tests**
You have Playwright tests but they're not running in CI.

Here's the updated CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

  push:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Added Node 24.x** to the test matrix (optional, but matches your local environment)
2. **Fixed coverage file path** to `./coverage/lcov.info`
3. **Added E2E test job** that:
   - Installs Playwright browsers
   - Builds the project
   - Runs E2E tests
   - Uploads test reports as artifacts
4. **Made build depend on both** unit tests and E2E tests
5. **Added `fail_ci_if_error: false`** to codecov to prevent failures if codecov is down

## Optional Improvements:

If you want to optimize CI time, you could:
- Remove Node 24.x if not needed
- Run E2E tests only on pull requests to master
- Cache Playwright browsers
- Run E2E tests in parallel by browser

The pipeline is mostly up-to-date, but adding E2E tests and fixing the coverage path are important updates!
