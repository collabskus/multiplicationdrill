# Migration Guide: HTML to TypeScript

This guide documents the migration from the original single HTML file to a TypeScript-based Vite project.

## What Changed

### Project Structure
- **Before**: Single `index.html` file with inline CSS and JavaScript
- **After**: Modular TypeScript files with proper separation of concerns

### Build System
- **Before**: No build system, direct browser execution
- **After**: Vite for development and production builds

### Type Safety
- **Before**: Plain JavaScript with no type checking
- **After**: Full TypeScript with strict type checking

### Testing
- **Before**: No automated tests
- **After**: Comprehensive test suite with Vitest

### CI/CD
- **Before**: Manual deployment
- **After**: Automated GitHub Actions pipeline

## Key Improvements

1. **Testability**: All logic is now unit tested
2. **Maintainability**: Code is modular and typed
3. **Performance**: Vite provides optimized production builds
4. **Developer Experience**: Hot module replacement, type checking, linting

## Migration Steps Taken

1. **Extracted Signal System** (`src/signals.ts`)
   - Preserved the exact reactive behavior
   - Added TypeScript types
   - Made it testable

2. **Separated State Management** (`src/state.ts`)
   - Centralized all application state
   - Kept computed signals intact

3. **Modularized Utilities** (`src/utils.ts`)
   - Extracted helper functions
   - Added proper error handling

4. **Preserved All Functionality**
   - Quiz mode works identically
   - Manual mode unchanged
   - Settings persistence maintained
   - Theme switching preserved
   - Animations and styling intact

## No Breaking Changes

The application behaves exactly the same as before:
- All features work identically
- LocalStorage keys are unchanged
- UI/UX is preserved
- No user-facing changes

## For Developers

### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (replaces opening HTML file)
npm run dev
```

### Making Changes

1. TypeScript will catch type errors at compile time
2. Tests ensure functionality isn't broken
3. Linter maintains code quality
4. CI/CD automates deployment

### Adding Features

The modular structure makes it easy to:
- Add new quiz modes
- Implement additional math operations
- Create new UI components
- Extend the signal system

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Reliability**: Tests prevent regressions
2. **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports growth
3. **Collaboration**: TypeScript and tests make it easier for others to contribute
4. **Performance**: Optimized builds and code splitting
5. **Modern Tooling**: Latest development tools and practices
