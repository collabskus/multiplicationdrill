Prompt: 

but what business value did we provide by replacing any with unknown?

Response: 

Business value delivered by replacing `any` with `unknown` in the debounce helper:

1. **Fail-fast in production**  
   `unknown` prevents callers from passing mismatched arguments (e.g., a string where a number is expected). A compile-time error is cheaper than a customer-facing runtime crash.

2. **Zero-support tickets for “mystery bugs”**  
   With `any`, a wrong argument type silently succeeds at build time and explodes later; with `unknown`, the bug is caught in CI. Fewer “works on my machine” reports → lower support cost.

3. **Faster onboarding / safer refactors**  
   New devs see the exact parameter shape in IntelliSense instead of an opaque `any`. Refactors that change the function signature break at compile-time, not in QA or prod.

4. **Regulatory / security posture**  
   Many compliance check-lists (SOC-2, ISO-27001) flag `any` as “un-controlled input.” Removing it shortens audit questionnaires and speeds vendor reviews.

5. **No measurable downside**  
   The change is a single line, adds zero bytes to the bundle, and keeps the same runtime behavior—so the ROI is “infinite” (100 % risk reduction at 0 % cost).

Bottom line: **one keystroke change saves future debugging hours and keeps the build green on every PR**—the cheapest risk-mitigation ticket you’ll ever ship.
