# Storybook Setup Summary

## ✅ What's Been Created

### Configuration Files
- `.storybook/main.js` - Storybook configuration (JavaScript, not TypeScript)
- `.storybook/preview.js` - Global settings and themes

### Story Files (src/stories/)
- `Display.stories.ts` - Display component in manual/question/answer modes
- `Button.stories.ts` - All button variants (start, stop, increment, reset, disabled)
- `Slider.stories.ts` - Time and difficulty sliders with all presets
- `Progress.stories.ts` - Progress bar in question/answer phases
- `FullApp.stories.ts` - Complete interactive application

### Documentation
- `STORYBOOK.md` - Comprehensive Storybook guide
- `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step workflow instructions
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference card
- `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Scripts
- `setup-storybook.sh` - Helper script to commit everything at once

## 🎯 Key Points

### Existing Workflow Preserved
Your existing `.github/workflows/storybook-test.yml` is perfect and includes:
- ✅ Node.js 22 (hard-learned: version matters!)
- ✅ yarn.lock deletion (hard-learned: prevents conflicts!)
- ✅ Detailed verification steps
- ✅ 7-day artifact retention

**No changes needed to the workflow!**

### Configuration Format
Using `.js` files instead of `.ts` for Storybook config:
- `.storybook/main.js` (not main.ts)
- `.storybook/preview.js` (not preview.ts)

This is simpler and works perfectly with your setup.

## 📦 Dependencies to Add

Add these to `package.json` devDependencies:

```json
{
  "@storybook/addon-essentials": "^8.5.0",
  "@storybook/addon-interactions": "^8.5.0",
  "@storybook/addon-links": "^8.5.0",
  "@storybook/blocks": "^8.5.0",
  "@storybook/html": "^8.5.0",
  "@storybook/html-vite": "^8.5.0",
  "@storybook/test": "^8.5.0",
  "storybook": "^8.5.0"
}
```

And these scripts:
```json
{
  "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
  "build-storybook": "storybook build"
}
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Use the Setup Script
```bash
chmod +x setup-storybook.sh
./setup-storybook.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a feature branch
2. Stage all Storybook files
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Optionally push to GitHub

### Option 2: Manual Steps
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-storybook

# Stage files
git add .storybook/
git add src/stories/
git add *.md
git add package.json

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: add Storybook support with component stories"

# Push
git push -u origin feature/add-storybook
```

## 🔧 Optional: Add GitHub Pages Deployment

If you want automatic deployment (not configured yet), add this job to your workflow:

```yaml
deploy-storybook:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build-storybook
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' && github.event_name == 'push'
  
  permissions:
    contents: write
  
  steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
  
  - name: Download artifact
    uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: storybook-build
      path: storybook-static/
  
  - name: Deploy
    uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      publish_dir: ./storybook-static
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Build fails**: Check Actions logs
- **Stories don't appear**: Verify .stories.ts file naming
- **CSS not loading**: Stories use your existing style.css
- **Types errors**: All stories are TypeScript
- **Questions**: See STORYBOOK.md or WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md
